## Name
-The name of the program is the Worker Ledger/Tracker.


## Description
-The program is specifically created to record a users estimated time spent on projects
-The program is supposed to record the date and time the user starts work and the time he/she ends the work.
-The program is meant to calculate the hours spent on the task and calculate the amount of money earned by tackling the task.


## Features
-The first section of the code gets you the name of the window you're working in. Making use of the c_type package with the create_unicode_buffer converting the name of the window in a bit form to be displayed.
