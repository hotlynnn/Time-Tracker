## Name
-The name of the program is the Worker Ledger/Tracker.


## Description
-The program is specifically created to record a users estimated time spent on projects
-The program is supposed to record the date and time the user starts work and the time he/she ends the work.
-The program is meant to calculate the hours spent on the task and calculate the amount of money earned by tackling the task.


## Features
-The first section of the code gets you the name of the window you're working in. Making use of the c_type package with the create_unicode_buffer converting the name of the window in a bit form to be displayed.

-The third section of the code computes the time. i.e. it calculates the total time.

-The fourth section of the code uses the computed time to calculate the amount of money the user earned.

-When the code is run, the user is prompted to enter the date and time the task will start and another prompt requests for the time the task is to end. This in turn displays the
Start_date:Start_time:End_date:Hours_spent:Income earned
